# Part-of-Speech-Tagging-Machine-Learning-Deep-Learning-Word2vec-fasttext-
Part of Speech Tagging of Sanskrit text using Machine Learning and Deep learning algorithms. Words were converted into vectors using Word2vec and fasttext.

The dataset we used were collected from Univrsal dependnecies.

The POS tagging application was developed using the machine learning algorithms and deep learning algorithms. The word embeddings were implemented uing both Word2vec and Fasttext.
